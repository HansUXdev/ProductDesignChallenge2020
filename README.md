# ProductDesignChallenge2020
A designs for product design.tips 2020 challenge.

## Why am I participating in this challenge?
Honestly, I just want to refresh myself on UX design stuff and try out [drawio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio) on a project. I also want to try and learn how to use [Helio](https://helio.app/) to gain product design feedback.

## Collaborating
I'm hoping to participate in a group with people to learn more about UX/UI, try out tools from the sponsors as well as others such as Draw.io and Helio App.

To communicate I plan to use zoom for group meetings and the the official [Slack channel](https://productdesigntips.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-90k78b9g-TvbJG_m_w15HZU3EjDGdHw#/) for communication and you can find me as `Hans` on there.


## Tools Used
1. [VSCode Extension Draw.io](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio)
2. [Productdesign.tips Chrome Extention](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/productdesigntips/jfkbdlhcdoooljpkfjfllhlgeejhabbb)

## Why on github?
Why not. Githu is awesome and you should be using it even if you don't code.


# Winning?
Trivial amount of money and free use of the sponsor products...
#### Grading:
- 54 out of 100 for Quality of work.

## 2. Audience
  1. List what are the categories of people you want to focus on.
  2. List what potential motivations and fears (concerns) your category might have.
  3. List potential situations (when and where) people face a problem you solving.
  4. List ideas through what digital products you can offer your solution to the audience.

  **Other tips** -- Use [affinity diagrams](https://productdesign.tips/post/1594968132642-case-study-template).

## Products / Competitive Analysis
- Products that already work with your audience
- How many users they have (estimations)
- What their missions are
- How they make money (business model)

## 4. SOLUTIONS
Write down ideas of features that can extend **existing apps' missions** and help to solve a problem. For each idea provide:
- Feature description
- How users will benefit from it
- How a company might benefit from it
Pick only one feature to prototype.


## 5. PROTOTYPE
Storyboarding. Map out the customer’s journey to get a picture of what interactions your product needs to support.

Defining tasks. Make a list of tasks the customer needs to complete to use your product successfully.
Speedy sketching. Sketch four possible interfaces for the product you’re trying to design.

## 6. TEST
This step is optional, but we suggest to at least include success metrics (how you will test your solution). Otherwise, prepare a test and ask a few people to test it. Make a summary of the results.

Guerrilla testing or use slack community to test your prototype and help test others.

## 7. SUBMIT YOUR WORK
Submit in the form of a **case study** (see templates/caseStudy.md).
